# On-Stage Tuning

##### Setting up the project for nDisplay

- TBD nDisplay setup, etc.



##### Launching a level on the Volume

- Black out the Volume screen
- FileSync: TBD details
- Switchboard: TBD details
- Unreal: open Stage Monitor ()



##### Checklist

- Unreal: move NDC camera to position the scene on the Volume
- Ask team: Happy with the scene position on the Wall
- Performance: Check Stage Monitor window in Unreal: FPS > 24 fps on Render PCs
- Look: Flickering or moir√© patterns on Volume (and visible in camera?)
- TBD: Other



##### Changing Levels

- Freeze or blackout wall
- Switchboard: close Unreal on all PCs ("X")
- Key project changes?
  - If edits were made in Unreal on the Control PC and were saved (and made persistent!), then run another FileSync to make sure Render PCs are updated
- Switchboard: choose new level from pop-up list
- Switchboard: connect and launch all PCs (Unreal will launch again)
- 
- TBD: note that NDC position will be at last level position!
